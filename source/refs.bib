abstract  ="The recently introduced sTDA methodology [S. Grimme{,} J. Chem. Phys.{,} 2013{,} 138{,} 244104] to compute excitation spectra of huge molecular systems is extended to range-separated hybrid (RSH) density functionals. The three empirical parameters of the method which describe a screened two-electron interaction are obtained for some common RSH functionals (ωB97 family{,} CAM-B3LYP{,} LC-BLYP) from a fit to theoretical SCS-CC2 reference vertical excitation energies for a set of small to medium-sized chromophores. The method is cross-validated on a set of inter- and intramolecular charge transfer states and a set composed of typical valence transitions. Overall small deviations from reference data of only about 0.2–0.4 eV are found with best performance for CAM-B3LYP and ωB97X-D3. To demonstrate versatility and robustness of the new methodology{,} applications (the UV/Vis spectrum of the pyridine polymer and the ECD spectrum of (P)-[11]helicene) and frequently used charge transfer examples are discussed. In one case{,} 11 000+ excited electronic states of a system containing 330 atoms were calculated. We show that the asymptotically correct sTDA–RSH combination yields results often superior to those based on global hybrids and that it opens up new possibilities for the computation of excited states in materials science and bio-molecular systems."}

abstract = {We present a simplified time-dependent density functional theory approach (sTD-DFT) that allows fast computation of electronic ultraviolet (UV) or circular dichroism (CD) spectra of molecules with 500–1000 atoms. The matrix elements are treated in the same way as in the recently proposed simplified Tamm-Dancoff approach (sTDA, S. Grimme, J. Chem. Phys., 138 (2013), 244104) but instead of applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, the standard linear-response density functional theory problem is solved. Compared to sTDA, the method leads to an increase in computation time (typically a factor of 2–5 compared to the corresponding sTDA) which is justified since the resulting transition dipole moments are in general of higher quality. This becomes important if spectral intensities (e.g. single-photon oscillator and rotatory transition strengths) are of interest. Comparison of UV and CD spectra obtained from sTD-DFT and sTDA for some typical systems employing standard hybrid functionals shows that both yield very similar excitation energies but the advantage of using the former approach for transition moments. In order to show the applicability of sTD-DFT to systems which are far beyond the scope of conventional TD-DFT, we present the CD spectrum of a substituted, chiral fullerene over a range of almost 1200 excited states. We propose this method as a more reliable alternative for the prediction especially of the more challenging CD spectra.}

abstract = {Abstract The equilibrium association free enthalpies ΔGa for typical supramolecular complexes in solution are calculated by ab initio quantum chemical methods. Ten neutral and three positively charged complexes with experimental ΔGa values in the range 0 to −21 kcal mol−1 (on average −6 kcal mol−1) are investigated. The theoretical approach employs a (nondynamic) single-structure model, but computes the various energy terms accurately without any special empirical adjustments. Dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) with extended basis sets (triple-ζ and quadruple-ζ quality) is used to determine structures and gas-phase interaction energies (ΔE), the COSMO-RS continuum solvation model (based on DFT data) provides solvation free enthalpies and the remaining ro-vibrational enthalpic/entropic contributions are obtained from harmonic frequency calculations. Low-lying vibrational modes are treated by a free-rotor approximation. The accurate account of London dispersion interactions is mandatory with contributions in the range −5 to −60 kcal mol−1 (up to 200 \% of ΔE). Inclusion of three-body dispersion effects improves the results considerably. A semilocal (TPSS) and a hybrid density functional (PW6B95) have been tested. Although the ΔGa values result as a sum of individually large terms with opposite sign (ΔE vs. solvation and entropy change), the approach provides unprecedented accuracy for ΔGa values with errors of only 2 kcal mol−1 on average. Relative affinities for different guests inside the same host are always obtained correctly. The procedure is suggested as a predictive tool in supramolecular chemistry and can be applied routinely to semirigid systems with 300–400 atoms. The various contributions to binding and enthalpy–entropy compensations are discussed.},
